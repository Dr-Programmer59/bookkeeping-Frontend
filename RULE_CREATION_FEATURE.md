# Auto-Rule Creation Feature

## Overview
Added automatic rule creation functionality when users manually change transaction categories. This feature helps streamline future transaction categorization by creating rules based on vendor patterns.

## Implementation Details

### New Features Added:
1. **Rule Creation Dialog**: Shows after manual category changes
2. **Smart Rule Suggestions**: Automatically suggests rules based on vendor names
3. **One-Click Rule Creation**: Users can create rules with a single click

### Technical Implementation:

#### 1. New State Variables
```typescript
const [showRuleDialog, setShowRuleDialog] = useState(false);
const [ruleDialogData, setRuleDialogData] = useState<{
  transactionId: string;
  vendorName: string;
  selectedCategory: string;
} | null>(null);
const [creatingRule, setCreatingRule] = useState(false);
```

#### 2. Enhanced Category Change Handler
- Updates transaction category as before
- Captures vendor name and selected category
- Shows rule creation dialog
- Provides user choice to create auto-categorization rules

#### 3. Rule Creation Function
```typescript
const handleCreateRule = async () => {
  await rulesAPI.createRule({
    client_id: selectedClient._id,
    vendor_contains: ruleDialogData.vendorName,
    map_to_account: ruleDialogData.selectedCategory
  });
};
```

#### 4. UI Components Used
- `AlertDialog` for rule creation confirmation
- Enhanced with vendor and category information display
- Loading states and error handling

### User Experience Flow:
1. User manually changes a transaction category
2. Transaction is updated and approved
3. Dialog appears asking if they want to create a rule
4. Dialog shows vendor name and selected category
5. User can choose "Yes, Create Rule" or "No, Skip"
6. If yes, rule is created via API call
7. Success/error feedback provided via toast

### API Integration:
- Uses existing `rulesAPI.createRule` endpoint
- Requires: `client_id`, `vendor_contains`, `map_to_account`
- Handles errors gracefully with user feedback

### Benefits:
1. **Improved Efficiency**: Reduces manual categorization for recurring vendors
2. **User-Driven**: Only creates rules when users want them
3. **Transparent**: Shows exactly what rule will be created
4. **Seamless Integration**: Works within existing transaction workflow
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures

### Future Enhancements:
- Rule editing/modification options
- Bulk rule creation from multiple transactions
- Rule preview before creation
- Advanced pattern matching options

## Testing Completed:
✅ TypeScript compilation passes
✅ UI components render correctly  
✅ State management working properly
✅ API integration ready
✅ Error handling implemented
✅ Loading states managed

The feature is production-ready and fully integrated into the existing transaction management workflow!
